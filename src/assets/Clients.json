        "projectDescription": "The Wings for Life World Run is a global charity event that aims to raise funds for spinal cord injury research. The unique aspect of the race is that there is no set finish line, and runners are pursued by the Catcher Car, which starts 30 minutes after the runners. The Catcher Car then gradually increases its speed, and when it passes a runner, their race is over. The last person running in each country are celebrated as the country winners.",
